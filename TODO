To Do:

Tactical:
Partially revert and generally clean up netcode. The options implementation is really cool, but we don't actually seem to need it.

Set up gitignore (I just accidentally checked in the binary)
Get set up on the 'hub - maybe as a private repo for now?
    Need to get set up with a legit kanban board too. I think gitlab has one, does the 'hub?
        They seem to be roughly equivalent

Generally catch up on tests and try to shift to a test-driven posture
    Add unit tests around room operations
    Add unit tests for transition
    Add unit tests for player operations

Add pose command? Technically, it would put us in good shape as a functioning RP server

Transitions should have messages shown on both sides when used.
    PCs don't have descs either. And there's no special message shown on connect/disconnect. Maybe this should be deferred to templating, though?

Strategic:
Prototype using ANTLR in a Go program

Start seriously designing the scripting and templating languages
    Will need to build out the command system more
        Account for scriptcommands at a variety of different levels
        Need command-defined parsing, likely as part of the scripting language

Persistence?
    Prototype SQLite (is there are newer alternative as an embedded database engine?)
    Prototype MongoDB

Web client
    Need to add web hosting to the app
    Prototype websockets, create websocket ClientAdapter
    Color and style formatting will have to be handled differently for web than telnet
